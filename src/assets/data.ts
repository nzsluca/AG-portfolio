    descript: 'The story of a families is usually passed on from parents to children by word of mouth, and is then passed on to grandchildren,  great-grandchildren and so on. Storytelling is a way of preserving and passing on the past, which can also be considered a kind of heritage. Listening to family anecdotes, I often think that while the individual is simultaneously shaped, changed, and developed by the changes of history, everything remains the same. Generations repeat the mistakes of their predecessors, only within the frame- work of a different system. This eternal change and eternal constancy characterizes our personal and collective history.There are stories that we like to tell and there are stories that we don’t talk about because they are too painful or we don’t considerthem important. The repressed grievances and emotions of my parents and grandparents are present, they arise here and there and affect my decisions, my thoughts, and my life. These untold stories and unspoken thoughts served as the basis of my work. I use photography as a past processing tool, I try to reveal the generational walls between us, the fears and traumas behind family traditions. The development of my identity was determined by a close female environment, my sisters, my mother and my grandmother are all  a constant part of my life. They are all tough and strong, and since I was a child, my everyday life was set by a strict framework. With the death of my grandmother, my connection to the lived history of the twentieth century also ends. The land that is now in our hands will pass to someone else, and a new family will start life on it. Disappearing generations also carry with them the legacies associated with older ages. What remains for me are the preserved objects, pictures on the wall, diaries or clothes in the back of the closet, all of which tell the story of the ideas, political systems and personal history of an era. However, the inheritance diminishes year by year like a family’s porcelain tableware. In my work, I try to connect with women’s destinies present in my past, thereby trying to get closer to understanding my own identity and values.',
